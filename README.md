# ASP.NET Read-Only Web API for Windows DHCP Server
An ASP.NET application providing HTTP interfaces for querying information about Windows-based DHCP servers, their scopes, clients, and reservations.
This application uses a .NET wrapper written by Gary Sharp (see [link to project](https://github.com/garysharp/DhcpServerApi)) for accessing Microsoft's native DHCP management API.
